# Student Registry

**Student Registry** is a practical application that employs the **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach to manage student information. It allows users to input names, ages, and email addresses, organizing these records into a table with options to perform these basic data operations. Ideal for educational environments, it facilitates efficient management of student data.
